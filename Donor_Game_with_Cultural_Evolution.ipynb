            "1.  **Understand the Goal:** As a donor, my aim is to maximize my long-term gains in an iterated game with limited information. This generally involves fostering cooperation while protecting against exploitation.\n",
            "2.  **First Round Decision:** In the absence of any prior information, a neutral, moderately cooperative stance is optimal. Donating 50% signals a willingness to cooperate without taking excessive risk or being overtly selfish. This sets a baseline for future interactions.\n",
            "3.  **Prioritize Information:** The most relevant information is what the current recipient (A) did in the *immediately preceding round*. This directly indicates A's recent propensity as a donor. Information about B and C (further down the chain) provides broader context but is less directly indicative of A's current behavior towards me.\n",
            "4.  **Adopt Reciprocity:** A successful strategy in iterated games is often based on reciprocity (Tit-for-Tat variants). If A was generous, I should be generous. If A was selfish, I should be cautious to avoid exploitation.\n",
            "5.  **Incorporate Chained Information:** The donations of B and C, while less direct, provide a \"temperature reading\" of the recent cooperation levels within the network. Averaging these with A's donation, but giving A's action the most weight, allows for a more nuanced response that considers both immediate reciprocity and environmental context. This acts as a form of \"Tit-for-Tat with memory.\"\n",
            "6.  **Develop a Weighted Average System:** To implement point 5, I will use a weighted average. A's immediate past donation (to B) will receive the highest weight (e.g., 3). B's past donation (to C) will receive a moderate weight (e.g., 2). C's past donation (to D) will receive the lowest weight (e.g., 1). If information for B or C is unavailable, it will simply be omitted from the average calculation (i.e., its weight and value will not contribute to the sum, and the total sum of weights will adjust accordingly). This ensures that the most recent and relevant action has the greatest influence on my donation.\n",
            "7.  **Finalize Decision Rule:** The calculated weighted average will directly determine my donation percentage. This strategy is \"nice\" (starts cooperative), \"provocable\" (reduces donations in response to low past donations), and \"forgiving\" (increases donations if past actions become more generous). \n",
            " Strategy: My strategy will beto donate 50% in the first round, and in subsequent rounds, to donate a weighted average of the available previous donations in the chain, giving the highest weight to my recipient's immediate past action. \n"

            "\n",
            "1.  **First Round Decision:** In the absence of any information, I need to make an initial move. A purely selfish (0%) donation might prevent exploitation but will not encourage future cooperation. A fully generous (100%) donation risks immediate exploitation. A moderately high donation (e.g., 75%) signals a willingness to cooperate and test the waters, inviting reciprocity without being completely naive. This allows me to establish a cooperative stance from the start.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Interpreting Recipient's (A's) Last Action:** A's donation to B in the immediately preceding round (X%) is the most direct and crucial piece of information about A's current behavior or intent. My response should be heavily influenced by this. A classic \"tit-for-tat\" strategy (matching A's last donation) is simple and effective for fostering cooperation, as it rewards generosity and punishes defection.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Incorporating Chain Information (B's and C's Actions):** The information about B's donation to C (Y%) and C's donation to D (Z%) provides a broader context or \"mood\" of cooperation in the recent past that led to A's action. While less direct than A's immediate action, it can help smooth out responses to single-round anomalies. For example, if A was unexpectedly low, but B and C were high, A might be an anomaly or reacting to something else; conversely, if A was high but B and C were low, A might be trying to initiate cooperation in a difficult environment. Averaging A's last action with the general trend of the chain can create a more robust response that accounts for both immediate behavior and the broader interaction history.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Balancing Reciprocity and Context:** The strategy needs to balance immediate reciprocity (responding to A's last action) with the contextual information from B and C. A simple weighted average or an average of A's last action and the overall chain average seems appropriate. This approach ensures I am responsive to A, but also resilient to individual strategic shifts or temporary deviations, by considering the broader history.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Handling Missing Information:** If B's or C's actions are not available (in earlier rounds), the calculation for the average chain must adapt, using only the available information and adjusting weights accordingly.\n",
            "\n",
            "6.  **Edge Cases (0% or 100%):** My donation should always be capped between 0% and 100% to remain within game constraints. \n",
            " Strategy: My strategy will beto initiate with a 75% donation in the first round and then base subsequent donations on an average of the recipient's most recent contribution and the average of all available preceding contributions in their interaction chain, ensuring the donation is capped between 0% and 100%. \n",

In such cases, I should be more forgiving than a simple matching strategy would suggest, to prevent a downward spiral of non-cooperation. The information about C (Z%) further clarifies B's character – if B was ungenerous despite receiving generously from C, B is clearly exploitative, making A's low X% even more justifiable.\n",

            "1.  **First Round - No Information:** As 1_12, I need to make an initial move without any data. A common strategy in such games is to start cooperatively but not overly generously. Donating a moderate-to-high percentage signals a willingness to cooperate and encourages others to do the same, preventing an immediate spiral into defection. Starting too low risks being perceived as selfish and triggers retaliation. Starting too high might lead to exploitation. A value like 75% is a good balance: clearly cooperative, but not maximally exploitable.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Subsequent Rounds - Prioritizing Information:**\n",
            "    *   **Recipient's (A's) Last Action (X% to B):** This is the most direct and crucial piece of information. It shows A's recent propensity to cooperate or defect. My primary response will be to mirror A's action (a form of Tit-for-Tat), as this promotes reciprocity. If A was generous, I should be generous. If A was stingy, I should be stingy to avoid exploitation.\n",
            "    *   **A's Partner's (B's) Last Action (Y% to C):** This provides vital *context* for A's action. A's donation (X) might be a reaction to B's previous action (Y) or B's reputation.\n",
            "        *   **Scenario 1: A exploited a cooperator.** If A donated a low X% to B, but B had donated a high Y% to C, then A actively chose to be uncooperative in a potentially cooperative or generous interaction. This suggests A is an exploiter. In this case, I should punish A more severely than just mirroring X.\n",
            "        *   **Scenario 2: A cooperated with an exploiter.** If A donated a high X% to B, but B had donated a low Y% to C, then A showed generosity or forgiveness despite facing an uncooperative partner. This is highly cooperative behavior that should be rewarded. I should be even more generous than just mirroring X.\n",
            "        *   **Scenario 3: Actions align or are moderate.** If A's and B's actions (X and Y) are roughly consistent (both high, both low, or both moderate), it suggests a reciprocal chain or a stable pattern. In this case, mirroring A's action (X) is the appropriate response to maintain that pattern or signal reciprocity.\n",
            "    *   **C's Last Action (Z% to D):** This information is further removed. While it adds to the general \"mood\" or reputation chain, its direct impact on my specific strategy for A is less critical than A's immediate output and its direct context (B's action). For a concise strategy, I will prioritize X and Y.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Strategy Refinement:** The core strategy should be to start cooperatively, then reciprocate A's most recent action, but adjust this reciprocity based on whether A was exploiting generosity or showing generosity in a tough situation. This combines Tit-for-Tat's effectiveness with an awareness of the immediate interaction's context. \n",
