            "1.  **Understand the Goal:** My aim is to develop a strategy that fosters cooperation over time, reflecting past behavior while protecting against exploitation. Since I am a donor, my actions will influence future interactions if I ever become a recipient or interact with these players again.\n",
            "2.  **First Round:** With no prior information, I must make an initial move. A neutral, moderately cooperative donation (e.g., 50%) is a good starting point. It signals willingness to cooperate without extreme vulnerability and acts as a test for the recipient's cooperativeness.\n",
            "3.  **Information Hierarchy:** The most crucial piece of information is the recipient A's immediately preceding donation (X%). This directly indicates their recent behavior as a donor. The information about B (Y%) and C (Z%) provides contextual history, showing a chain of donations leading up to A's recent interaction, which can inform whether A's action was part of a trend or a deviation.\n",
            "4.  **Adaptive Response:** My donation should primarily be a reaction to A's immediate past behavior (X). However, incorporating Y and Z allows for a more nuanced, \"memory-infused\" reciprocity, where I can account for the broader environment A was operating in.\n",
            "5.  **Weighted Averaging:** To combine these pieces of information, a weighted average is suitable. The highest weight should be given to A's immediate action (X), followed by B's action (Y), and the least weight to C's action (Z), reflecting decreasing relevance with time/distance. This approach balances immediate responsiveness with historical context.\n",

            "\n",
            "1.  **First Round (No Information):** In the absence of any prior behavior, I need to establish a baseline. A successful strategy in repeated interactions often involves an initial cooperative gesture. Starting with a high, but not maximum, donation (e.g., 75%) signals willingness to cooperate and encourages the recipient to reciprocate, allowing for the potential formation of a mutually beneficial relationship. It also provides the first data point.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Primary Reaction (Recipient's Immediate Past Action - X%):** The most direct and crucial piece of information about the current recipient (A) is what they donated in the immediately preceding round (X% to B). My strategy should primarily react to this. If A was generous (high X%), I should reciprocate generously to reward and encourage continued cooperation. If A was ungenerous (low X%), I should respond cautiously to protect myself from exploitation, potentially matching a low donation but not necessarily zero, to leave a small opening for future cooperation. This forms the core of a \"tit-for-tat\" or \"generous tit-for-tat\" approach.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Secondary Adjustment (Broader Context from Chain - Y%, Z%):** While A's direct action (X%) is paramount, the information about B's donation (Y% to C) and C's donation (Z% to D) provides valuable context about the general cooperativeness of the environment A was operating in.\n",
            "    *   If A was unusually ungenerous (low X%) in an otherwise cooperative chain (high Y%, Z%), it might indicate an exploitative player or a strategic test. My response should remain cautious, but I might slightly increase my donation above X% to offer a chance for A to revert to cooperation.\n",
            "    *   Conversely, if A was unusually generous (high X%) in a generally uncooperative chain (low Y%, Z%), it might signal an attempt to initiate cooperation, or a risky move. I should still respond generously, perhaps slightly tempering it if the overall environment suggests A might be exploited themselves.\n",
            "    *   This contextual information helps me understand if A is an outlier, following a trend, or adapting to a specific partner, allowing for a more nuanced and adaptive reciprocity than pure tit-for-tat. The aim is to promote cooperation over time while protecting against consistent exploitation. \n",
            " Strategy: My strategy will beto initiate with a generous donation and then primarily match the recipient's immediate past donation (X%), while making subtle adjustments based on the average cooperativeness observed in the available preceding interaction chain (Y% and Z%). \n",

            "\n",
            "1.  **First Round - No Information:** In the very first round, I have no data on A. A common and often successful approach in repeated social dilemma games is to start by being cooperative. This signals a willingness to engage positively and can encourage the recipient to also cooperate. If I start with 0%, it immediately signals defection and risks breaking down any potential for mutual gain. Starting with a very high donation (e.g., 100%) is a strong cooperative signal, putting the onus on A to reciprocate. This sets a positive tone and provides immediate data on A's response.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Understanding the Information Chain:**\n",
            "    *   **A's action (A to B):** This is the most direct and recent information about *my current recipient's* behavior. It's the strongest indicator of how cooperative A currently is.\n",
            "    *   **B's action (B to C):** This tells me about the partner A just interacted with. If B was generous, A might have been influenced to be generous, or perhaps B's generosity enabled A to be generous without fear of being exploited. It's indirect, but still relevant context.\n",
            "    *   **C's action (C to D):** This is the furthest removed in the chain. It provides a more general \"vibe\" of the cooperation level in the recent past, but its direct influence on A's specific action is likely minimal compared to A's direct interaction with B.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Designing a Reciprocity Rule:** The core of such games is often reciprocity. I should reward cooperation and deter defection.\n",
            "    *   **Direct Reciprocity:** My donation should heavily depend on what A did to B. If A donated a high percentage to B, I should donate a high percentage to A. If A donated a low percentage, I should donate a low percentage.\n",
            "    *   **Indirect Influence:** The actions of B to C and C to D provide a broader environmental context. If everyone in the chain was cooperative, it might suggest a higher general level of trust, which could slightly temper my response to a moderately low $D_A$ or reinforce a high $D_A$.\n",
            "    *   **Weighted Average:** A good way to combine these pieces of information is using a weighted average. The most recent and direct action ($D_A$) should have the highest weight, as it's the freshest and most pertinent to A's current behavior. The next action ($D_B$) should have a lesser weight, and the furthest action ($D_C$) the least. This reflects the diminishing relevance of information as it gets older and further removed from the recipient.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Handling Limited Information in Early Rounds:**\n",
            "    *   **Round 2:** Only $D_A$ is available. My donation should simply match $D_A$ (a direct Tit-for-Tat based on A's last action).\n",
            "    *   **Round 3:** $D_A$ and $D_B$ are available. I use the weighted average for these two.\n",
            "    *   **Round 4 onwards:** All three pieces of information ($D_A$, $D_B$, $D_C$) are used in the weighted average.\n",

            "    *   $D_B$ (B's action to C): Weight of 2\n",
            "    *   $D_C$ (C's action to D): Weight of 1\n",

A 100% donation (Strategy 1) is very risky and can lead to immediate exploitation. A 50% donation (Strategy 2) is a safe middle ground. To be more proactive and encourage cooperation strongly without taking extreme risk, a slightly higher initial donation like 75% seems optimal. It's a clear signal of willingness to cooperate while retaining a buffer against defection.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Information Relevance:** The available information consists of `D_A` (recipient's last donation), `D_B` (partner's partner's last donation), and `D_C` (partner's partner's partner's last donation).\n",
            "    *   `D_A` is the most direct signal of the current partner's recent behavior and intent. This should be the primary driver of my donation.\n",

            "\n",
            "3.  **Improving on Previous Strategies:**\n",
            "    *   **Strategy 1 (Weighted Average):** Donating 100% initially is too risky. While its weighted average for subsequent rounds (`(3D_A + 2D_B + 1D_C)/6`) cleverly uses the chain, it treats `D_A` primarily as part of a general chain history rather than a direct, immediate signal from the current partner. It might not be responsive enough to my partner's *immediate* reciprocity or defection. If `D_A` is 0, but `D_B` and `D_C` were high, it would still donate a significant amount, potentially rewarding defection too much.\n",
            "    *   **Strategy 2 (Conditional Reciprocation):** The 50% initial donation is reasonable. The concept of \"conditionally reciprocate... dynamically adjusting to reward proactive generosity and penalize opportunistic stinginess\" is strong, but it lacks a concrete mechanism. It doesn't specify *how* it uses the chain information to adjust.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Formulating a Hybrid Approach:**\n",
            "    *   My strategy should primarily be a form of *tit-for-tat* towards my current partner's most recent action (`D_A`), as this is the most direct and actionable information.\n",
            "    *   However, this direct reciprocity should be *tempered* or *influenced* by the broader context of the chain (`D_B`, `D_C`), reflecting the \"dynamic adjustment\" aspect of Strategy 2 and leveraging the chain information like Strategy 1.\n",
            "    *   Let's define an \"Environmental Index\" (E) based on the weighted average of available past donations, similar to Strategy 1's subsequent round logic: `E = (3 * D_A + 2 * D_B + 1 * D_C) / (sum of available weights)`. This captures the general generosity trend.\n",
            "    *   My donation should then be a blend: mostly `D_A` (direct reciprocity), but with a portion influenced by `E` (environmental context). A 75% weight on `D_A` and 25% on `E` provides strong direct reciprocity while still being sensitive to the broader history. This also naturally handles cases where `D_B` or `D_C` are not available, as `E` would then rely more heavily on `D_A`. For example, if only `D_A` is known, `E = D_A`, and the donation becomes `0.75 * D_A + 0.25 * D_A = D_A`, which is pure tit-for-tat—an appropriate response when only direct information is available.\n",

            "1.  **First Round Dilemma:** No information is available. A 100% donation (Strategy 1) is too naive and exploitable. A 50% donation (Strategy 2) is balanced but could be slightly more proactive. A slightly higher, but not fully exposed, initial donation (e.g., 60-70%) signals strong willingness to cooperate while retaining some caution. I will opt for 60%.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Information Hierarchy:** The information provided (`D_A`, `D_B`, `D_C`) has varying relevance.\n",
            "    *   `D_A` (recipient A's last donation to B) is the most direct signal of *my current recipient's* recent behavior. This should heavily influence my decision.\n",
            "    *   `D_B` (B's last donation to C) and `D_C` (C's last donation to D) represent the broader \"ambient generosity\" or \"cooperativeness\" of the interaction chain A is part of. They provide context but are less direct indicators of A's individual propensity to donate.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Improving on Strategy 1 (Weighted Average):** Strategy 1 uses fixed weights (3:2:1 for `D_A:D_B:D_C`). While reasonable, it might not dynamically adjust enough. For example, if `D_A` is very low, but `D_B` and `D_C` are high, the weighted average might still lead to a generous donation towards a potentially stingy A. I want `D_A` to have an even stronger, more direct impact.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Improving on Strategy 2 (Conditional Reciprocation):** Strategy 2's core idea of \"conditionally reciprocate the recipient's last donation, dynamically adjusting to reward proactive generosity and penalize opportunistic stinginess\" is sound. However, its implementation is vague. I need to quantify how `D_A` is \"reciprocated\" and how the \"dynamic adjustment\" based on the chain occurs, making it robust to missing chain information.\n",

            "    *   **Subsequent Rounds:** I will prioritize `D_A` as the primary signal. If `D_A` is high, I want to be generous; if low, less so. However, I'll temper this direct reciprocation with the overall cooperativeness observed in the entire available chain (`D_A`, `D_B`, `D_C`). This blends the direct responsiveness to A's action with the environmental context. I will use a 70% weighting for `D_A` and 30% for the average of all available donations in the chain. This approach ensures that if only `D_A` is known, I simply match `D_A`, fulfilling the \"reciprocate recipient's last donation\" aspect precisely. As more chain information becomes available, it subtly nudges my donation towards the general trend of the chain, acting as the \"dynamic adjustment.\" \n",
